<p>The English word "mosque" denotes a Muslim house of worship. The word evolved from the Arabic term masjid, which means "place of prostration." During prayer, Muslims briefly kneel and touch their foreheads to the ground as a sign of submission (literally, Islam) to the will of God</p>

<p>The Jama Masjid of Bijapur (also known as Jamiya Masjid or Jumma Masjid) is a congregational mosque in the Indian state of Karnataka. Initiated by Ali Adil Shah I of the Bijapur Sultanate in the 16th century, the mosque was never completed. It is the largest mosque in Bijapur, and has a capacity of 4000 worshippers.</p>

<p>The Prophet Muhammad's original house in Medina (in present-day Saudi Arabia) is thought to be the first mosque and probably served as a model for early mosque architecture. It was a mud-brick structure with living quarters on one side of an enclosed rectangular courtyard. Since Muhammad's followers would gather at his home for prayer, the side of the courtyard facing the qibla, or the direction of prayer, included a porch covered by palm branches, which offered shelter from the hot desert sun. </p>
